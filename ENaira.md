# The Complete Guide to E-Naira and the Nigerian Economy

## Introduction

In this post I talked about the newly introduced eNaira currency, what it is, why you should use the eNaira, how to use eNaira and the future of the eNaira. 
Most Nigerians have not started using the eNaira because they don’t know where to begin. We would like to provide as much information as possible to get started. Here is a step-by-step guide to get you started on the right foot.

## Launch of the ENaira Platform
Nigeria’s Central Bank announced the approval of a new currency called eNaira on 25th October 2021. Prior to this approval, the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele [announced](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/463912-nigeria-will-soon-create-digital-currency-cbn.html) that eNaira plan will help to capture the 55% of unbanked adults in Nigeria.
The currency is a solution to the country’s rampant inflation, and also helps fight corruption, tax evasion, and other illicit activities.
Contrary to most people’s opinion, the eNaira is not a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Ethereum, or any other crypto. Since it is not decentralised, it cannot be privately controlled the way cryptocurrencies are. However, it was built on the blockchain technology, which means it cannot be faked or duplicated. Although in a [research paper](https://blog.chainalysis.com/) published by Adedeji Owonibi, CEO of Convexity, a blockchain consultancy, he said; “The only reason to use the eNaira over cryptocurrency would be trust in the government, and that trust has been eroded for many,”
ENaira is a central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria as a legal tender. Enaira was not created to replace the physical naira, rather to act as a digital representation of it. The e-Naira will not earn any interest to holders.The eNaira comes with a mobile wallet that will allow people to make payments by scanning QR codes with their smartphone or sending money directly from one person to another through text messages.
Aside other benefits, eNaira will increase revenue and tax collections, assist targeted social interventions, and improve diaspora remittances.

In line with Section 2 of the CBN Act 2007, the CBN is the issuing authority of all forms of Naira. The Central bank will also determine the technical, regulatory and operational standards for eNaira.

Another issue of concern is whether the eNaira is a stable currency. We must bear in mind that a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency backed by reserves that are currencies or other assets, such as gold, that can be readily transferable. A good example of a stablecoin is the USDT, which is tied to the US dollar, and maintains a stable exchange value.
The eNaira is however linked to Nigeria currency (Naira) which is not stable, for the eNaira to be stable however, it has to be linked to a stable currency like dollar or euro.

## How does one use ENaira?
You can either fund your eNaira wallet throug

(i)     your regular bank app from your bank account;

However, there is no transaction or speed wallet limit for Merchants.

## How will I identify a merchant accepting ENaira?
According to CBN, effort is being made to put signages and decals at designated merchant locations. While at that, customers can simply ask the merchants if they accept eNaira.
During the [launching](https://punchng.com/enaira-33-banks-join-platform-as-cbn-mints-500m/) of the eNaira, the Governor of CBN said, “33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform, 500 million has been successfully minted by the Bank, N200 million has been issued to financial institutions, over 2,000 customers have been onboarded and over 120 merchants have successfully registered on the eNaira platform.”

## How is the eNaira different from the Online Banking Transaction?
The online transaction requires an intermediary like banks, but in the case of eNaira there are no intermediaries.

## Is the eNaira platform secured?
eNaira is safe and secured, and has advanced cryptographic techniques against counterfeiting, cloning and other forms of breaches. The eNaira wallet operates an open system that is accessible to all users based on a tiered KYC structure.

## How do I resolve failed transaction on the Enaira platform?
You can reach out to your designated bank or you could email CBN’s eNaira Customer Support via helpdesk@enaira.com.

## Future of Nigeria economy with the Enaira
For the eNaira to be successful, it will require a good number of Nigerians to accept the new system. This includes companies and government agencies. Nevertheless, eNaira will be troubled by some of the current issues of the country, including illiteracy, lack of power, lack of internet coverage, and the volatility of the Nigerian currency.
Though the Presentation is tentative as the CBN is yet to issue a draft guideline or framework on the operation of eNaira, this project appears to be a step in the right direction to achieving a cashless economy.
